# Movie-Recommendation-System
### Idea:
Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer “relevant” suggestions to users. Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, all function on recommendation systems where the system recommends you the next video or product based on various aspects

### Dependencies :
  ```
  numpy
  pandas
  scipy
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  ```

### Cosine Similarity:
The movie plots are transformed as vectors in a geometric space. Therefore the angle between two vectors represents the closeness of those two vectors. Cosine similarity calculates similarity by measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
